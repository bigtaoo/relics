# 3 minutes it moves to the next key (agreed with the owner on 2026-09-30; the free tier
# seems to have a daily image quota per workspace). Other errors fail at once.
# The key that last succeeded is remembered in ~/.vibe/mistral_last_key, so the next run
# starts there. MISTRAL_KEY=A|B|C|D|E forces the starting key. Gives up after 15 minutes.
